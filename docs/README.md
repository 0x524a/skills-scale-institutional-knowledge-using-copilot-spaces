# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

This folder contains OctoAcme's project management process documents. This README is a central reference to quickly understand our approach, find the right process documents, and get started contributing.

Purpose
- Provide an onboarding and discovery entrypoint for project management processes.
- Make it easy to find the right checklist, template, and guidance for each stage of a project's lifecycle.
- Standardize how teams plan, execute, and improve cross-functional work.

Project management processes — brief overview
- Customer-first, iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments and measure outcomes.
- Clear roles and ownership: every project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead (PdM).
- Lifecycle stages: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective.
- Communication & escalation: regular syncs, single source of truth for status, and defined escalation paths for blockers and incidents.
- Tools & artifacts: use project boards, checklists, one-pagers, risk registers, and release notes to maintain transparency.
